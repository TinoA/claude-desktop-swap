# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Preserve per-account Local Storage, IndexedDB, Session Storage, and Cloudflare security cookies during switches to avoid unnecessary device or human verification prompts.
- Roll back every replaced account-state directory when a restore fails, including paths that did not exist before the attempted switch.
- Refresh the active profile before export and refuse incomplete legacy-profile backups; imports identify accounts that still need a one-time refresh.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Local profile health states (`usable`, `expired`, `missing`, and `unknown`) based on non-secret SQLite evidence.
- Cookie-only v2 profiles with integrity metadata, secure permissions, atomic generation recovery, and compatible v1 reads.

### Changed
- Switching now fully stops Claude and its helpers, checkpoints the outgoing profile before restoration, replaces live Cookies atomically, and advances tracking only after commit.
- `save --force` now refuses to snapshot an open database; all saves require Claude to be stopped.
- Local Storage, IndexedDB, and Session Storage are cleared as volatile caches instead of stored in profiles; global and machine data remain untouched.

### Fixed
- Refreshed outgoing cookies are no longer discarded during repeated account switches.
- Interrupted profile writes and live-cookie replacement retain a recoverable prior generation.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- `add <name>` command — snapshots your current session, gives Claude Desktop a clean slate to log into a new account, then snapshots that new session. Removes the manual logout/login dance for adding accounts.

### Changed
- Binary renamed from `claude-swap` to `claude-desktop-swap` to avoid collision with an unrelated tool
- `save` now primes the on-disk state right after capturing the profile (sets it as active and wipes stale per-account caches), so the next switch always lands cleanly without needing a manual `use` first

### Fixed
- Profile snapshots now include `IndexedDB`, `Session Storage`, and `ant-did` — stale per-account state from a previous profile was invalidating the restored session and forcing a re-login

### Added
- `save` command — snapshot the current Claude Desktop session as a named profile
- `use` command — switch to a saved profile (kills and restarts Claude Desktop)
- `list` command — list saved profiles with creation date and last used timestamp
- `delete` command — remove a saved profile
- `status` command — show the currently active profile
- Full session isolation: both cookies (SQLite) and local storage (LevelDB) are swapped on profile switch
- macOS platform implementation with graceful SIGTERM → SIGKILL shutdown sequence
- Platform abstraction layer for future Windows support
- CI pipeline (lint + tests on Ubuntu and macOS) via GitHub Actions
- CD pipeline (GoReleaser) triggered on SemVer tags — builds macOS binaries (amd64 + arm64)
- `CODEOWNERS` and branch protection documentation for maintainer-approval workflow
- `.gitmessage` commit template following Conventional Commits
